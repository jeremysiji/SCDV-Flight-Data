✈️ Flight Data Analysis – SCDV 499
This project focuses on the analysis, processing, and visualization of aviation-related data for the SCDV 499 Capstone course. It aims to derive insights from flight data by cleaning, transforming, and interpreting datasets with meaningful features. The ultimate goal is to support predictive modeling and operational decision-making in the aviation sector.

📁 Project Overview
The core of this project involves:

Exploring large-scale flight and airport operation datasets

Understanding and applying provided data definitions (see Download_Column_Definitions.xlsx)

Cleaning and preprocessing data for modeling

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Developing models to detect delays, cancellations, and other patterns in flight operations

Visualizing key metrics and trends

🧾 Files Included
Download_Column_Definitions.xlsx: Contains definitions and descriptions of all data columns used in the analysis. This is essential for understanding the structure and semantics of the raw datasets.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebooks

Excel (for schema documentation and data verification)

📊 Goals
Analyze trends in flight performance

Identify key contributors to delays and cancellations

Create visual dashboards for stakeholders

Provide documentation and tools for reproducible research

📌 Notes
This repository is part of the coursework for SCDV 499 (Senior Capstone Data Visualization) and is intended for academic use.
